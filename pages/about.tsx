                        One small thing that brings me a lot of joy is the &quot;year ago&quot; feature on Snapchat.
                        Every time I see a memory from a year ago, it reminds me of where I was at that time,
                        the challenges I&apos;ve faced since then, the happiness I&apos;ve experienced, and the friendships I&apos;ve made.
                        It&apos;s a really powerful way to reflect on my journey over the past year.
                        <br /><br />
                        As I was thinking about all these memories, I realised that I really want to find a better way to capture them.
                        One of my good friends is an avid journaler, while I tend to rely more on taking photos.
                        So I had an idea: what if we combined the two approaches and created a &quot;social journalling&quot; project?
                        We could help each other remember and document all the special moments we&apos;ve shared, and even
                        add in details that the other person might have missed.
                        <br /><br />

                    <div className="text-center">
                        <p>
                            That&apos;s the goal of this project â€“ to create a<br />
                            <b className="font-semibold"> meaningful and interactive way to keep track of our memories.</b>
